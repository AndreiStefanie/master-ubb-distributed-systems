# master-ubb-distributed-systems

Repo containing all projects and assignments for the Distributed Systems Master Programme from UBB Cluj-Napoca, 2021-2023.

The master's programme is pretty demanding with some projects requiring some serious devotion, this being one of the reasons I am making this public.

**Do not just copy any of the projects - you will get caught when you will be asked to explain it**. Also, the entire point of the projects is to learn and, in some cases (e.g. RDSOS, MFPC, GDAC, AMCDS, and a few others), you will learn a lot. This will be helpful no matter what path you take in your career, I promise - I had 6-7 years of experience and I still learned and understood a lot.
